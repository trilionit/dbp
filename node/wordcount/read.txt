United were unable to find a way past an inspired Tom Heaton, and in the second half Mourinho watched from the stands after reportedly being sent off after venting his frustrations.

Despite continuing to dominate the match, United were reduced to 10 men in the 68th minute after Ander Herrera received a second yellow, leaving United four league matches without a win.

The Red Devils pressed for a breakthrough regardless of their numerical disadvantage, but Burnley held on despite coming under heavy pressure.
Sergio Aguero starred to ensure Manchester City returned to winning ways and are top of the table on goal difference, as he netted twice in a 4-0 win over West Bromwich Albion.

Aguero, restored to the starting XI, scored his first City goal in over a month when Ilkay Gundogan fed the Argentina international, who made no mistake against goalkeeper Ben Foster.

City doubled their advantage in the 28th minute, Aguero again on target with a thunderous drive into the top corner from distance.

Gundogan then grabbed the goal that ensured Pep Guardiola's team are above Arsenal on goal difference, the Germany international assisted by Aguero.

Former Borussia Dortmund player Gundogan put the icing on the cake for Guardiola, who had gone six matches without a win in all competitions, to make it 4-0 late on.

Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez both scored braces as second-placed Arsenal recorded a 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in Saturday's early kickoff.
